## A Tech for Good Manifesto

What does Tech for Good mean to you?  As a new wave of Coders, we have the power to effect
change.  We can choose to strengthen our democracy, or we can allow it to be further undermined and eroded.  What is abundantly clear to me is that our current system is failing the vast majority.  Not addressing the problem over the previous few decades has brought us to where we are now.  

Tech has played its part.  I put it to you that we need to reevaluate the norms by which
we work, our codes of practice.  Tech has enabled us to live
in an echo chamber where we exist unchalleged, less able to effect change and increasingly fed only
information that certain algorithms determine.  I propose (and these are not my words),
that "we have fetishized disruption".  But disruption has had unintended consequences and is totally
out of control.  Robot accounts caused “#TrumpWon” to trend after each TV debate, allowing him to claim “victory”.  There is no doubt that algorithms are influencing the democratic process.  They give us
only what they think we want and not what we necessarily need.  And that has helped place our society in a precarious
situation, where the very fabric of democracy is under threat and the rules are being
rewritten.  And that needs to be challenged.  The question is: how?

What is clear to me is that we
have power at our fingertips, in the code we write.  And we encode our values and beliefs.  So how do we reach the unreachable and bridge the growing divide?  Break through the echo chamber walls and turn
the great Disruption into the great Harmony <a href="https://www.powerthesaurus.org/disruption/antonyms/3">(Find a better antonym for "Disruption" if you can)</a>? That will by my goal
here and I hope to share it with some of you.  Lets open up a forum of discussion.

### Manifesto

1. We determine our future and our relationships through the choices we make.

* Neoliberalism limits our choices by placing profit above people and the planet, serving the few rather than the many.

* A true democratisation of Tech demands a democratisation of choice.  Social
Progress is the democratisation of choice.  (True choice is an ideal - in reality
we are limited by time, resources etc).

* Social responsibility, duty of care and protecting the communal interest can be
personalised.  Our individual choices shape our collective future.

* The current system limits our choices whilst insisting we are
free to choose.

* Every decision we make, every choice, every solution to a problem/need, has a social,
economic and environmental impact.

* How can Tech reframe our choice Paradigm?  By illuminating the consequences of
choice.

* The data is there - put humanity back in the system!
