## Narrative Tracker - a Measure of Democracy

#### Proposal

We can use Data to measure a society's proneness to radicalisation and instability.  Also it's degree of Normalisation.

###### How?

 * Analyse the key parts (ie. Title and 1st paragraph) of news articles from a range of the most prolific and influential news outlets.

 * Identify and chart the progression of key narratives over time.  This should form an Overton window on the x axis (representing political bias left or right) and time on the y axis.
  * One could also chart public opinion and key policy changes/proposals:  how strongly coupled these lines are gives an indication of how "controlled" a socio-political sphere of influence is.

 * Algorithms need to identify subject; object; context (hard); a range of opinion; where a particular item from a particular outlet sits on that range; a "degree of radicalness".

 * What kind of distribution would this be?  Gaussian?  
  * Also chart an individual feed against the background of wider narratives.
  * To counteract radicalisation and hypernormalisation, how to balance the feed?
  * A filter/plugin?
  * What "should" the distribution look like in a healthy society?

 * Identify key areas/hot topics:
  * Immigration
  * Wars
  * Race relations
  * Living Standards
  * The economy
  * Climate changes
  * Education
  * Housing
  * Privatisation vs Nationalisation

 * On Facebook: how strongly tied our personal declared interests are to our personal feed and how strongly coupled liking/clicking certain items is to the chance of those items/similar items reoccuring?
